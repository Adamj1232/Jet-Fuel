## Reflection
  - This project was a 2 person group project and our first project to creat and format a backend server.  We had 4 days to work together and produce an operational application with quality ux/ui.
  - We set out to build an application for users to create or select a folder and save shortened URL for any website the user chooses. 
  - We used Node, Express and SQL tables to store and route shortened URLs.
